# Phase 2 Project Description
## Overview


A real estate agency in Kingsway seeks to determine what are the contributing factors that affect the price of houses to make improvements where necessary. They want to employ an analytical approach rather than sentimental before arriving at a decision. Multilinear regression has been used for this project to understand how various features affect their pricing to better their services.
