# Phase 2 Project Description
## Overview


Data Understanding:

The real estate agency in Kingsway is analyzing a dataset to determine the factors affecting house prices. The dataset likely includes features such as property size, location, age, and market trends. Key steps include assessing data quality, exploring relationships between features and prices, and preprocessing data for multilinear regression analysis. Multilinear regression will be used to model how these features collectively influence house prices, with evaluation metrics used to assess predictive accuracy.
