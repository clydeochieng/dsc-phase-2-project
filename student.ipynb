        "A real estate agency in Kingsway seeks to determine what are the contributing factors that affect the price of houses to make improvements where necessary. They want to employ an analytical approach rather than sentimental before arriving at a decision. Multilinear regression has been used for this project to understand how various features affect their pricing to better their services."

        "In this project, we utilized the King County House Sales dataset, which serves as the foundational dataset for our analysis. It was sourced Kaggle.The dataset encompasses comprehensive information regarding house sales within King County, Washington, USA. It comprises a diverse array of features, including the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, as well as geographical and pricing details of the properties sold. This dataset is frequently employed in data science and machine learning endeavors, particularly for predictive modeling tasks such as regression analysis aimed at forecasting house prices based on the provided features."
